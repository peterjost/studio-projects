Created the Issue and initialized the Project Diary. It will be used during project realisation to keep track of problems. Project pitch files uploaded on GitHub. Looking forward to some feedback of my peers.

A nice topic, since many people in Switzerland are into mountain sports (and many people know somebody who has had a fatal accident in the mountains). What struck me with your chart is that the highest number of deaths occurs within the 40-49 years old bracket. This is surprising. I would have thought that most accidents involve younger people, adventurers who are willing to take on large risks. But the data tells us a different story: That you have the highest risk of dying in the alps when you are a middle-aged person, perhaps because you are overestimating your physical abilities and doing hikes / climbs that you shouldn't be doing any more. Maybe you can focus on this age category.

Interesting topic! Especially now that most of your peers start reserving their winter vacations up in the mountains! I definitely agree with Simon, it's quite striking to see that most people who lose their lives are in the 40-49 age group. Is there also maybe a trend over time? Has it gone better or worse? And has there been any regulation passed that maybe explains it?

It is really a surprise that hikers are more often involved in fatalities than mountaineers or climbers.
Worked on my graphs, made them a bit nicer.

Uploaded the first Draft on Github. Looking forward to some more feedback.

Researched for the text, read some articles about the topic and went deeper into the topic on the bfu website. Started to write.

Almost finished the text. Worked on the graphs, changed them into some more mountain-like ones. Worked also on colours and legends. Updated the draft, looking forward to some more feedback.

Finished the text, combined it with the graphs to an article (Illustrator work). Uploaded the .png-file to the personal website.
