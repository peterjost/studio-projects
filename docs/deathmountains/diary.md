Created the Issue and initialized the Project Diary. It will be used during project realisation to keep track of problems. Project pitch files uploaded on GitHub. Looking forward to some feedback of my peers.

A nice topic, since many people in Switzerland are into mountain sports (and many people know somebody who has had a fatal accident in the mountains). What struck me with your chart is that the highest number of deaths occurs within the 40-49 years old bracket. This is surprising. I would have thought that most accidents involve younger people, adventurers who are willing to take on large risks. But the data tells us a different story: That you have the highest risk of dying in the alps when you are a middle-aged person, perhaps because you are overestimating your physical abilities and doing hikes / climbs that you shouldn't be doing any more. Maybe you can focus on this age category.

Interesting topic! Especially now that most of your peers start reserving their winter vacations up in the mountains! I definitely agree with Simon, it's quite striking to see that most people who lose their lives are in the 40-49 age group. Is there also maybe a trend over time? Has it gone better or worse? And has there been any regulation passed that maybe explains it?

It is really a surprise that hikers are more often involved in fatalities than mountaineers or climbers.
Worked on my graphs, made them a bit nicer.

Uploaded the first Draft on Github. Looking forward to some more feedback.

Researched for the text, read some articles about the topic and went deeper into the topic on the bfu website. Started to write.

Almost finished the text. Worked on the graphs, changed them into some more mountain-like ones. Worked also on colours and legends. Updated the draft, looking forward to some more feedback.

Finished the text, combined it with the graphs to an article (Illustrator work). Uploaded the .png-file to the personal website.

Peter, so, I don't think the number of deaths is quite constant as you state. It looks like in 2011 there were over 100 deaths in in 2012 only about 60. That is a big difference. That is all your classmates and each of their significant others.

What I do see here that the number of deaths is more a reflection of the number of people who do a certain sport than is is the chances that you are going to die doing that sport. You have not normalized these data.

If I look at this it looks like climbing and canyoning are safe sports. But if you take the total number of climbers deaths each year and divide them by the total number of climbers what percentage do you get? If there are 1,000 hikers and 300 die, that is 30% of all hikers. But if there are 100 climbers and 50 die -- that's 50%. So a smaller number may die by climbing, but it's a riskier sport.

The age group chart in your first draft is charted properly. We should not use fever lines for this, because that implies there is a connection between the datapoints that there is not. What is interesting there is you see 70 yr olds are more likely to die by hiking but people in their 20s die by climbing the most of all ages. I'd want to find out how many people of each age do each sport and how likely they are to die from it, and what are those relationships.

This is an excellent dataset and a good start. You have, however, just scraped the surface. It's plotted very clearly and I like that you show us different things. But remember to look for what is really different in the dataset.

Nice work.
