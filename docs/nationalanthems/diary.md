Nice Idea! Some people think bad of wordclouds but in this case it's a very powerful tool to summarize the data and bring across a couple of good points. Also, I like the idea of coloring the charts in the respective flag colors of a country. Can you compare groups of countries against one another (eg european vs asian countries)?

I really like the fact that it's a simple idea but still very informative and it speaks in the heart of every person! I would like to see more correlations related to the topic of each anthem. And maybe pick the 2-3 more interesting ones in terms of the findings and explain more about the historical events that are connected to the lyrics so as to give it a serious journalistic spin.

Working on the project, the dataset and some visualizations.
Made some investigation for the text.

Draft is online (late), but only visualizations of a few countries. I completed the dataset and made the visualizations nicer in Illustrator. I decided to do a .png-file as final version.

Second draft is online, looks not so bad. Looking forward to some more feedback.
